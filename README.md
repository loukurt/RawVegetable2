# Tutorial
## Loading Spectra Files
-	Spectra data can be loaded from files in the *.raw, *.mzML, *.ms1 or *.mgf formats, by either dropping them on the main screen or by clicking at **File** and then **Load Files**. Multiple files can be loaded at the same time. (Note: for *.ms1 files, RawVegetable will attempt to find the respective *.ms2 file necessary for some modules, if it cannot be found, the features will be disabled. The same will happen for *.mgf if it only contains MS1 spectra)
